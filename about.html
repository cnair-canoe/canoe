        </div>
       <p>This project documents the creation of a traditional Anishinaabe birchbark canoe by Ojibwe master birchbark canoe builder Wayne Valliere during his stay at Northwestern University in October 2021. A class of undergraduate students studying journalism and/or environmental policy and culture under the instruction of Professor Patty Loew all contributed to this project. The course, Native American Environmental Issues and the Media, which includes a class trip to the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin during their white corn harvest, prepares students to enter the worlds of journalism and environmental policy with an in-depth understanding of the inextricable connection between Indigenous communities and the environment. By showcasing Valliere’s work through a wide variety of mediums – from interactive web design to a short video documentary to written articles – the students embraced many different facets of journalism in order to tell the story. </p>
